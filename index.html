            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h2>👨‍💻🌏🏊‍♂️</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Jeremy, a senior at Davidson College majoring in Computer Science with minors in Data Science and Chinese Studies. I’ve had the chance to grow up internationally, from Thailand to Singapore, and now in the U.S., which has shaped how I approach challenges and think creatively.</p>
            <p>As a student-athlete and captain of the Davidson Men’s Swimming Team, I’ve learned the value of hard work, teamwork, and resilience—qualities I bring to everything I do. My interests lie at the intersection of creativity and technology, whether it’s designing clean, user-friendly websites or finding data-driven solutions to real-world problems.</p>
            <p>I’ve been fortunate to experience life in different countries and connect with people from all walks of life, which has given me a fresh perspective on problem-solving and creativity. Outside of academics and swimming, I enjoy brainstorming creative ideas, traveling, and finding inspiration in the diversity of experiences and stories around me.</p>
            <p>This website is a way to share my skills and projects while giving a glimpse into what drives me. Thanks for stopping by—let’s connect!</p>
